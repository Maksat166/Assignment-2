How the program works

First, different vehicle objects are created.  
Then drivers are assigned to each vehicle.  
All vehicles are stored in an array.  
Using a loop, the engine is started, vehicle information is displayed, and the engine is stopped for each vehicle.

Reflection

Inheritance helped keep the code clean and organized.  
Method overriding allowed each vehicle to have its own behavior.  
The main difficulty was using access modifiers like `protected` correctly.
